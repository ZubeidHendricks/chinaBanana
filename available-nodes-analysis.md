# N8N Cloud Node Availability Analysis

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis of n8n documentation and the workflow URL inspection, here are the key findings for your n8n Cloud instance:

### Authentication Status
- ✅ **Workflow requires authentication** - The specific workflow URL redirects to a sign-in page
- ✅ **n8n Cloud instance is accessible** at `zubaid.app.n8n.cloud`
- ❗ **Cannot inspect actual workflow nodes** without authentication

### Available Core Nodes (Documented & Likely Available)

Based on n8n's official documentation, these core nodes should be available in your n8n Cloud instance:

#### **Trigger Nodes**
- ✅ **Manual Trigger** - Start workflows manually
- ✅ **Webhook** - Receive HTTP requests to trigger workflows
- ✅ **Schedule Trigger** - Run workflows on a schedule
- ✅ **Respond to Webhook** - Send responses back to webhook callers

#### **Core Processing Nodes**
- ✅ **HTTP Request** - Make HTTP API calls to external services
- ✅ **Code** - Execute JavaScript/Python code
- ✅ **Edit Fields (Set)** - Modify, add, or remove data fields
- ✅ **Switch** - Route data based on conditions
- ✅ **Wait** - Add delays in workflow execution

#### **Advanced Nodes**
- ✅ **LangChain Code** - AI/ML integrations
- ✅ **Custom Code Tool** - Advanced code execution

## Recommended UGC Workflow Architecture

Since the core nodes appear to be available, you can build a UGC generation workflow using:

### **Workflow Structure**
```
1. Manual Trigger or Schedule Trigger
   ↓
2. HTTP Request (to Bright Data for competitor analysis)
   ↓
3. Code Node (to process and structure the data)
   ↓
4. HTTP Request (to Google Gemini API for content generation)
   ↓
5. Code Node (to format and structure the generated content)
   ↓
6. HTTP Request (to post to social media platforms)
```

### **Alternative Node Names to Try**
If the standard node names don't work, try these variations:

#### **Instead of `@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.webhook`:**
- Try: `Webhook`
- Try: `webhook`
- Try: `Manual Trigger` + `HTTP Request` combination

#### **Instead of `@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`:**
- Try: `HTTP Request`
- Try: `http`
- Try: `httpRequest`

#### **Instead of `@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.code`:**
- Try: `Code`
- Try: `code`
- Try: `JavaScript`

### **Simplified Node Reference Format**
Based on the analysis, try using these simpler node references:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Manual Trigger",
      "type": "Manual Trigger"
    },
    {
      "name": "HTTP Request",
      "type": "HTTP Request"
    },
    {
      "name": "Code",
      "type": "Code"
    },
    {
      "name": "Set",
      "type": "Edit Fields (Set)"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Access your workflow directly** by signing into `https://zubaid.app.n8n.cloud`
2. **Check the node palette** by clicking the "+" button to add nodes
3. **Take note of exact node names** as they appear in your interface
4. **Test with simplified node names** like "HTTP Request" instead of "@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest"

## Plan Limitations

- ✅ **No plan limitations mentioned** in the documentation
- ✅ **Core nodes should be available** on n8n Cloud
- ❓ **Some advanced integrations** may require higher-tier plans

## Screenshots Available

The following screenshots were captured for reference:
- `n8n-docs.png` - Main documentation page
- `core-nodes.png` - Core nodes documentation
- `webhook-docs.png` - Webhook node documentation
- `http-request-docs.png` - HTTP Request node documentation
- `workflow-access-attempt.png` - Workflow access attempt (shows sign-in page)

## Confidence Level: HIGH ✅

Based on the official documentation analysis, there's high confidence that:
- Webhook nodes ARE available
- HTTP Request nodes ARE available  
- Code nodes ARE available
- Basic workflow automation should work

The issue is likely with the **node reference format**, not node availability.
